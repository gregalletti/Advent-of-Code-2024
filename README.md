# 🎄🎄 Advent of Code 🎄🎄
This repository contains the solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024 challenge.

Solutions are written in **Python** 🐍. 

Daily challenges usually have two parts, and the solutions are both written in the same file named as `/solutions/YEAR_DAY.py`

- `template.py` contains the basic structure for each day's solution file.
- `utils.py` contains help functions like automatic download of the input file, better print, etc.

## TODO
Publish **Java** ♨️ version as well
